Cryptogram.py is a simple tool I designed to help me solve the cryptoquotes in the newspaper. I got tired of crossing out or deleting wrong letters or having to use another piece of paper to work on my solution. This short program does not solve the cryptogram. It simply allows me to enter the original ciphertext and play with the possible solutions without wasting paper or ink.

ListOfSeqFields.py came in handy when I had to write embedded SQL update or insert statements for tables that had several fields with the same root and a sequential number as their suffix.
